Sidenotes
==========

Annotate the web.

## Writing notes on the web is clunky and frustrating.

The current process is all too familar. While reading articles or watching videos online, we come across useful information that we would like to jot down to store our thoughts. 

Pause a video, leave an article, switch tabs, then jot down useful pieces of information. Then go back to the video or article, and find where you left off. This wastes minutes of time _everyday_.

We find ourselves accessing the same sites time and time again looking for a single piece of information we found useful last time we accessed the site. 

We were frustrated with the disconnect between traditional note-taking, and the fluid nature of the web, so we came up with a [solution](sidenotes.co).

# Write notes quickly without distraction

[Sidenotes](sidenotes.co) is the fastest way to write notes in your browser. No more switching tabs, pausing videos, or running multiple apps to jot down your thoughts.

Sidenotes is always there when you need it. With the single click of a button, or a single keystroke, you are writing. 

We eliminate any unnecessary steps, leaving you with the simplest process for taking notes & *annotating the web*.

## Sidenotes, the App

Sidenotes is packaged into a simple Chrome Extension, meaning your notes are never far away. 

We leverage the power of the Dropbox Datastore API and Google Chrome Local Storage to sync your notes immediately, both _online_ and _offline_.

A simple keystroke slides in the extension's note pad from the right side of your screen. 

Your notes are linked with the URL where you took the note and will appear upon your next visit. 

If you need to pull up a past note or url you may visit our search page, which will allow you to redirect back to the URL and have your note ready to edit.

## Installation

Sidenotes is built entirely in HTML, CSS & JavaScript. You can download it...
