SideNotes
==========
SideNotes is a chrome extension for the seamless integration of a notepad within your chrome browser. Using the power of the Dropbox datastore API and Chrome Local Storage your notes are never far away. A simple keystroke slides in the extension's note pad from the right side of your screen. Your notes are linked with the URL and will appear upon your next visit. If you need to pull up a past note or url you may visit our search page, which will allow you to redirect back to the URL and have your note ready to edit.
